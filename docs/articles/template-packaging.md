# Template Packaging

This repository includes a `dotnet new` template scaffold and a NuGet template package project.

The scaffold can be installed locally from source for development, or packed into a `.nupkg` and installed through the same package-based flow expected for consumers.

Package-based validation is preferred because it verifies the actual distribution artifact instead of only the repository working tree.

## Template Identity

| Field | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Template short name | `netcoreapp-template` |
| Template package ID | `CDCavell.NetCoreApplicationTemplate` |
| Source replacement token | `ProjectTemplate` |
| Current package version | `0.5.5` |

## Consumer Scaffold Boundaries

The scaffolded output intentionally includes:

- Source projects under `src/`.
- Baseline tests under `tests/`.
- Docker support files.
- `LICENSE.txt`.
- `ASSETS-LICENSES.md`.
- A consumer-oriented `README.md` generated from `.template.content/README.md`.

The scaffolded output intentionally excludes repository-maintainer content such as:

- `.github/` workflow and issue-template files.
- `.template.config/` and `.template.content/` authoring files.
- DocFX documentation source and ADRs.
- Changelog, citation, contribution, security, and release-management files.
- Repository maintainer badges and release instructions.

## Golden Scaffold Manifest

The approved default scaffold surface is tracked in `eng/scaffold-manifest.default.json`.

The manifest is validated by `eng/Validate-ScaffoldManifest.ps1` after CI packs the template package, installs the generated `.nupkg`, and scaffolds the default `ContosoSecurityPortal` project.

The manifest check fails when:

- An expected consumer file is missing.
- An expected consumer directory is missing.
- An unexpected root-level file is generated.
- A maintainer-only path such as `.github/`, `.template.config/`, `.template.content/`, `docs/`, `eng/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CITATION.cff`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASE.md`, or `SECURITY.md` appears in the scaffolded output.
- The generated consumer README contains repository maintainer content such as workflow badges or the current-release block.

The manifest intentionally allows recursive content under `src/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/` because those folders are part of the consumer scaffold surface. Root-level additions should be added to `expectedFiles` only when they are intended public scaffold files.

### Validate a Generated Scaffold Locally

After packing and installing the template package, generate the default scaffold:

```powershell
dotnet new netcoreapp-template -n ContosoSecurityPortal --output ./artifacts/scaffold/ContosoSecurityPortal
```

Validate the scaffold against the checked-in manifest:

```powershell
./eng/Validate-ScaffoldManifest.ps1 -ScaffoldRoot ./artifacts/scaffold/ContosoSecurityPortal
```

### Intentionally Update the Manifest

When the public scaffold surface intentionally changes, regenerate the scaffold from the packed `.nupkg`, inspect the generated output, and then refresh the manifest:

```powershell
./eng/Validate-ScaffoldManifest.ps1 -ScaffoldRoot ./artifacts/scaffold/ContosoSecurityPortal -Generate
```

Review the manifest diff carefully before committing. Changes to root-level files, maintainer-only exclusions, template source boundaries, README content checks, or public scaffold folders should be treated as release-surface changes before `v1.0.0`.

## Pack the Template Package

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet pack ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.Template.csproj --configuration Release --output ./artifacts/template-package
```

## Install the Template Package

```powershell
dotnet new install ./artifacts/template-package/CDCavell.NetCoreApplicationTemplate.0.5.5.nupkg
```

## Create a New Project from the Template

From a separate working directory:

```powershell
dotnet new netcoreapp-template -n ContosoSecurityPortal
```

Use a project name that is also a valid C# identifier, such as `ContosoSecurityPortal`. Dotted project names require additional template symbol handling so namespace replacement and type-name replacement can be handled separately.

This creates a new project using `ContosoSecurityPortal` as the replacement name for the source template namespace and project prefix.

## Template Options

The template intentionally exposes a small set of stable options for common scaffold variants.

| Option | Default | Supported values | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `--authProvider` | `cookie` | `cookie`, `none` | Selects the generated authentication baseline. Use `cookie` for the default cookie-authentication-ready baseline or `none` to generate the application with application authentication disabled by default. |
| `--dbProvider` | `sqlite` | `sqlite`, `sqlserver` | Selects the generated EF Core provider configuration. Use `sqlite` for the default local development configuration or `sqlserver` for the SQL Server provider configuration. |

Example non-default scaffold:

```powershell
dotnet new netcoreapp-template `
  --name ContosoNoAuthSqlServer `
  --authProvider none `
  --dbProvider sqlserver
```

All supported variants preserve the template's core infrastructure guardrails, including structured logging, centralized error handling, health checks, security headers, rate limiting, and safe defaults.

### Authentication-disabled variant

The `--authProvider none` option generates the application with `ProjectTemplate:Authentication:Enabled` and `ProjectTemplate:Authentication:Cookie:Enabled` set to `false`.

The application still includes the authentication and authorization infrastructure so consumers can enable or replace authentication later. Test cases that intentionally exercise protected endpoints may enable test authentication through in-memory test configuration.

## Restore, Build, and Test the Generated Project

```powershell
cd ContosoSecurityPortal
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

## Update the Installed Template

Install the newer package version:

```powershell
dotnet new install <path-or-package-id-for-new-version>
```

The .NET SDK updates the installed template package when the package identity matches and the new package version is higher.

## Uninstall the Template

```powershell
dotnet new uninstall CDCavell.NetCoreApplicationTemplate
```

## Local Repository Install

For local authoring and quick iteration, the template can still be installed from the repository root.

On Windows:

```powershell
dotnet new install .\
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
dotnet new install ./
```

Then generate from a separate working directory:

```powershell
dotnet new netcoreapp-template -n ContosoSecurityPortal
```

Local repository install is useful during template development, but package-based install should remain the primary validation path before release.

## CI Smoke Test

The CI workflow packs the template package, installs the generated `.nupkg`, scaffolds a new project with `dotnet new netcoreapp-template`, validates the scaffolded output against the golden manifest, builds the generated output, runs generated tests, and uninstalls the template package.

The smoke test runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS so path handling and package install behavior are validated across supported runner environments.

On Linux runners, CI also validates the Docker consumer path from the generated scaffolded output. This Docker smoke test builds the generated Docker image, validates `docker compose config`, starts the generated Compose application, verifies `/health/live`, captures Compose logs for diagnostics, and tears down the Compose stack during cleanup.

Docker runtime validation is intentionally limited to Linux runners. The goal is to prove that Docker files emitted by the template are usable by a generated consumer project, not to certify Docker host behavior across every operating system.

## Distribution Direction

The intended stable distribution model is a published NuGet template package installable with `dotnet new install`.

Future stable usage is expected to follow this pattern:

```powershell
dotnet new install CDCavell.NetCoreApplicationTemplate
dotnet new netcoreapp-template -n ContosoSecurityPortal
```

Clone-and-modify remains valid for source review, contribution, and direct customization. However, after package publishing is available, the NuGet template package should be treated as the primary stable distribution path for normal template consumers.

After the `v1.0.0` release, changes to the template short name, package identity, template parameters, symbols, or source-name replacement behavior should be reviewed as release-surface changes.

See [ADR-0003: Record Release Surface and Distribution Strategy](../adr/0003-record-release-surface-and-distribution-strategy.md) for the release-surface decision.
