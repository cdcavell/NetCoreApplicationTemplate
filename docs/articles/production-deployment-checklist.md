# Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying an application generated from the .NET Core Application Template to a production environment.

This checklist is intentionally operator-focused. It does not replace organization-specific security, compliance, change-management, or infrastructure review.

## 1. Release and Build Readiness

```text
[ ] Application source is built from the intended commit, branch, or release tag.
[ ] Release configuration build succeeds.
[ ] Tests pass.
[ ] CI status is green.
[ ] Package, image, or deployment artifact version is identifiable.
[ ] Generated application README matches the deployed artifact behavior.
[ ] Release notes identify any configuration, deployment, or migration requirements.

## 2. Hosting and Environment

```text
[ ] `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `Production`.
[ ] Public host names are known.
[ ] `AllowedHosts` is configured for expected production hosts.
[ ] HTTPS is enforced at the correct layer.
[ ] TLS termination location is documented.
[ ] Deployment slot, region, and environment names are documented.
[ ] Platform-specific startup command or container entry point is verified.
```

## 3. Reverse Proxy and Forwarded Headers

```text
[ ] Reverse proxy, load balancer, ingress, or gateway topology is documented.
[ ] Forwarded headers are enabled only when required.
[ ] Trusted proxies or known networks are configured.
[ ] Forward limit matches the deployment topology.
[ ] Host forwarding is enabled only when required.
[ ] Public HTTPS scheme is preserved correctly.
[ ] Redirects do not loop behind the proxy.
[ ] Authentication callback URLs use the public HTTPS origin.
```

- [Deployment Notes](deployment.md)

## 4. Middleware Order

```text
[ ] Forwarded headers run before components that depend on scheme, host, or client IP.
[ ] Request logging runs early enough to capture useful request context.
[ ] Centralized error handling is registered before endpoint execution.
[ ] Security headers are applied before responses are sent.
[ ] HTTPS redirection behavior is compatible with proxy/TLS termination.
[ ] Static files are served before endpoint routing when expected.
[ ] Routing, CORS, rate limiting, authentication, and authorization order is preserved.
[ ] Controller and Razor Page endpoint mapping remains last.
```

## 5. Logging
```text
[ ] Production log sinks are configured.
[ ] Log retention expectations are defined.
[ ] Request correlation IDs are available.
[ ] Sensitive values are not logged.
[ ] Authentication secrets, tokens, connection strings, and provider secrets are not logged.
[ ] Warning and error events are routed to the expected monitoring destination.
[ ] Startup failures are observable.
```

## 6. Error Handling and Problem Details

```text
[ ] Non-development exception handling route is active.
[ ] Status code pages are configured as expected.
[ ] API error responses use Problem Details where appropriate.
[ ] Browser error pages do not expose sensitive implementation details.
[ ] 404, 500, and validation-style responses are smoke tested.
[ ] Development exception details are not enabled in production.
```

## 7. Security Headers

```text
[ ] Security headers are enabled.
[ ] Content Security Policy is reviewed against deployed assets.
[ ] Script, style, image, connection, and frame directives are intentional.
[ ] `frame-ancestors` behavior matches embedding requirements.
[ ] Permissions Policy is reviewed.
[ ] Referrer Policy is reviewed.
[ ] Cross-origin header behavior is tested with authentication and static assets.
[ ] No broad wildcard sources are used unless intentionally accepted.
```

- [Configuration](configuration.md)

## 8. Rate Limiting

```text
[ ] Global rate limit values match expected traffic.
[ ] Queue limits are intentionally chosen.
[ ] Authentication, API, administrative, or expensive endpoints have appropriate limits.
[ ] Health checks and infrastructure probes are not accidentally blocked.
[ ] Expected client behavior after `429 Too Many Requests` is documented.
[ ] Logs or metrics can identify rate-limit pressure.
[ ] Limits will be revisited after real production traffic is observed.
```

- [Deployment Notes](deployment.md)

## 9. Health Checks

```text
[ ] `/health` behavior is understood.
[ ] `/health/live` is configured for liveness probes.
[ ] `/health/ready` is configured for readiness probes.
[ ] Infrastructure probe paths and methods match application behavior.
[ ] Health responses do not expose sensitive dependency details publicly.
[ ] Load balancer or orchestrator health behavior is tested.
```

- [Deployment Notes](deployment.md)

## 10. Telemetry

```text
[ ] OpenTelemetry settings are reviewed.
[ ] Service name and environment metadata are correct.
[ ] OTLP endpoint is configured when telemetry export is enabled.
[ ] Metrics and traces are routed to the expected backend.
[ ] Telemetry does not include sensitive values.
[ ] Sampling/export behavior is appropriate for production volume.
```

- [Telemetry](telemetry.md)
- [Logging](logging.md)

## 11. Authentication and Authorization

```text
[ ] Cookie settings are production appropriate.
[ ] External provider client IDs are configured.
[ ] External provider client secrets are supplied by secret storage.
[ ] Redirect and callback URLs match the public HTTPS origin.
[ ] Claims transformation behavior is reviewed.
[ ] Role and permission claim conventions are documented.
[ ] Unauthorized and forbidden behavior is tested.
[ ] Sign-in and sign-out flows are smoke tested.
```

## 12. Data Access

```text
[ ] Production database provider is selected intentionally.
[ ] Production connection string comes from secret storage or protected environment configuration.
[ ] Database account uses least privilege.
[ ] EF Core migrations are reviewed before production execution.
[ ] Migration execution is an explicit deployment step.
[ ] Database backup/restore approach is understood before schema changes.
[ ] Connection resiliency and timeout expectations are reviewed.
[ ] Local development database settings are not used in production.
```

```text
[ ] Image tag matches the intended release.
[ ] Container listens on the expected port.

[ ] Container health probe uses the documented path.
[ ] Container logs are captured by the platform.
[ ] Docker Compose or orchestrator configuration has been validated.
```

## 14. Final Production Smoke Test

Before completing deployment, verify:

```text
[ ] Application starts successfully.
[ ] Home page or expected root endpoint responds.
[ ] `/health/live` responds as expected.
[ ] `/health/ready` responds as expected.
[ ] A known 404 path returns the expected response.
[ ] A known API route returns the expected response.
[ ] Static assets load.
[ ] Authentication flow works, if enabled.
[ ] Logs contain expected startup and request entries.
[ ] No secrets appear in logs or responses.
```

## 15. Rollback and Hotfix Readiness

```text
[ ] Previous deployable version is available.
[ ] Database rollback or forward-fix strategy is understood.

## Summary

A production deployment is ready when the generated application has been validated as an application, as a deployment artifact, and as an operator-owned service.

The template provides a production-oriented baseline, but each environment must still make explicit decisions about hosting, trust boundaries, secrets, logging, telemetry, rate limits, health checks, authentication, and data access.
