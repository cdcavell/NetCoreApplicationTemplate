# .NET Core Application Template Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the .NET Core Application Template.

NCAT is a production-oriented ASP.NET Core application baseline. The default scaffold enables local cookie authentication and configures a fallback authorization policy that requires an authenticated user for routed endpoints without authorization metadata. Public routes are explicit anonymous exceptions. The `--authProvider none` variant is a deliberate opt-out that disables application authentication, cookie authentication, and authenticated fallback access.

Authentication establishes identity. Authorization determines whether that identity may access an endpoint or operation. NCAT also provides policy-based authorization, middleware ordering, request protection, observability, error handling, health checks, and EF Core data access patterns.

The template includes consistent defaults for:

- Application startup and middleware ordering
- Serilog structured logging
- Forwarded headers and reverse proxy support
- Security headers
- Rate limiting
- Centralized exception and status code handling
- Problem Details responses
- Health checks
- OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics
- Cookie authentication and optional external identity providers
- Authenticated-by-default routed endpoints and named authorization policies
- EF Core data access patterns
- GitHub Actions validation
- Package-based `dotnet new` template scaffolding

Use this documentation as the detailed reference. The root `README.md` provides the project summary and quick-start information.
