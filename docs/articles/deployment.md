# Deployment Notes

This article provides initial deployment guidance for applications created from the .NET Core Application Template.

The template includes production-oriented defaults for middleware ordering, forwarded headers, security headers, rate limiting, health checks, structured logging, error handling, authentication foundations, and EF Core data access. These defaults are intended to provide a safe baseline, but every deployment environment should still be reviewed before production use.

## Deployment Review Areas

Before deploying an application created from this template, review the following areas:

- Reverse proxy, load balancer, or ingress behavior.
- Forwarded header trust boundaries.
- Environment-specific configuration.
- Secrets and connection string storage.
- HTTPS enforcement and certificate termination.
- Content Security Policy values.
- Rate limit values and queue behavior.
- Health check exposure.
- Database migration execution strategy.
- Logging destinations and retention.

## Reverse Proxy Deployments

Applications are commonly deployed behind a reverse proxy, load balancer, ingress controller, gateway, or hosted platform. In those environments, Kestrel may see the proxy as the immediate client unless forwarded headers are configured correctly.

Review the hosting path for:

- TLS termination location.
- Original client IP preservation.
- Host header forwarding.
- Scheme forwarding from HTTPS to the application.
- Health check probe paths and methods.
- Request size limits.
- Timeout behavior between the proxy and application.

The application should not blindly trust forwarding headers from arbitrary clients. Forwarded headers should only be trusted from known proxies or known networks.

## Forwarded Headers

Forwarded headers are configured under `ProjectTemplate:ForwardedHeaders`.

Production deployments should explicitly configure trusted proxy addresses or networks:

```json
"ProjectTemplate": {
  "ForwardedHeaders": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "ForwardLimit": 1,
    "KnownProxies": [
      "10.0.0.10"
    ],
    "KnownNetworks": [
      "10.0.0.0/24"
    ],
    "AllowedHosts": [
      "example.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

Recommended production posture:

- Enable forwarded headers only when the application is actually behind trusted infrastructure.
- Keep `ForwardLimit` as low as the deployment topology allows.
- Prefer explicit `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks` values.
- Avoid clearing known proxy and network restrictions unless the hosting environment requires it and another trusted boundary is present.
- Only enable host forwarding when required.
- Configure `AllowedHosts` when host forwarding is enabled.

See [Forwarded Headers and Proxy Support](forwarded-headers.md) for the detailed forwarded header configuration model.

## Environment-Specific Configuration

Use environment-specific configuration to separate local development settings from production settings.

Common layers include:

- `appsettings.json` for shared defaults.
- `appsettings.Development.json` for local development overrides.
- Environment variables for deployment-specific values.
- User secrets for local-only developer secrets.
- Hosting platform secret stores for production secrets.

ASP.NET Core configuration uses a layered model where later providers can override earlier providers. Production deployments should avoid storing production secrets directly in committed JSON files.

Example environment variable names can use double underscores to represent nested configuration keys:

```powershell
$env:ProjectTemplate__RateLimiting__GlobalFixedWindow__PermitLimit = "120"
$env:ProjectTemplate__SecurityHeaders__EnableContentSecurityPolicy = "true"
$env:ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection = "Server=...;Database=...;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;"
```

## Secrets and Connection Strings

Do not commit production secrets, production connection strings, certificates, tokens, client secrets, or signing keys to the repository.

Recommended production posture:

- Store production secrets in the hosting platform secret manager or an approved external secret store.
- Use encrypted connection strings where supported.
- Use least-privilege database accounts.
- Rotate secrets when access changes.
- Keep development connection strings separate from production connection strings.
- Prefer environment-specific overrides over editing committed base configuration.

Local development may use user secrets for sensitive development-only values:

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Data Source=projecttemplate.db" --project src/ProjectTemplate.Web
```

## HTTPS and Certificate Termination

Production deployments should serve public traffic over HTTPS.

When TLS terminates at a reverse proxy or load balancer, confirm that:

- The proxy forwards the original scheme to the application.
- Forwarded headers are trusted only from the proxy.
- Redirect behavior does not create loops.
- Public endpoints generate HTTPS URLs where applicable.
- Authentication callback URLs match the public HTTPS origin.

When TLS terminates directly in Kestrel, configure certificates through the hosting environment or approved certificate management process.

## Production Content Security Policy Review

The template includes configurable security headers and a conservative baseline Content Security Policy. Production applications should review the CSP before release.

Review these directives carefully:

- `default-src`
- `script-src`
- `style-src`
- `img-src`
- `connect-src`
- `frame-ancestors`
- `form-action`
- `base-uri`

Recommended production posture:

- Allow only trusted script, style, image, frame, and connection sources.
- Avoid broad wildcard sources where practical.
- Avoid `unsafe-inline` for scripts in production when the application can support nonce, hash, or bundled script approaches.
- Keep `frame-ancestors 'none'` unless the application is intentionally embedded.
- Test authentication, documentation pages, static assets, and external provider redirects after CSP changes.

See [Security Headers](security-headers.md) for the detailed security header configuration model.

## Rate Limit Tuning

The template includes baseline global and named rate limiting policies. Default limits are intentionally conservative and should be reviewed before production use.

Review rate limits against expected traffic:

- Normal browser traffic.
- API client traffic.
- Authentication redirects and callbacks.
- Health checks and monitoring probes.
- Static file and documentation traffic.
- Administrative or resource-heavy endpoints.

Recommended production posture:

- Tune permit limits based on measured traffic rather than guesswork.
- Keep queue limits low for public-facing endpoints unless the user experience requires queuing.
- Use concurrency limits for expensive or contention-prone operations.
- Monitor `429 Too Many Requests` responses after deployment.
- Consider stricter policies for authentication, export, reporting, administrative, or integration endpoints.
- Revisit limits after real traffic patterns are known.

See [Rate Limiting](rate-limiting.md) for the detailed rate limiting configuration model.

## Health Checks

Health checks are useful for load balancers, uptime monitors, and container orchestration platforms. Production deployments should verify that health check endpoints are exposed only as broadly as needed.

Recommended production posture:

- Keep simple liveness probes safe for infrastructure access.
- Avoid exposing sensitive dependency details publicly.
- Use infrastructure rules to restrict detailed health information if needed.
- Confirm probe method, path, and expected status code with the hosting platform.

## Database Migrations

The template documents EF Core migration execution guidance separately. Production deployments should avoid applying migrations automatically on application startup unless that behavior is explicitly accepted for the target environment.

Recommended production posture:

- Run migrations as an explicit deployment step.
- Review generated SQL before production execution when required.
- Back up production databases before schema changes.
- Keep migration execution separate from normal web request startup.

See [Data Access](data-access.md) for migration and provider guidance.

## Deployment Validation Checklist

Use this checklist before production release:

```text
[ ] Confirm hosting environment and TLS termination path.
[ ] Confirm forwarded header settings match the reverse proxy topology.
[ ] Confirm trusted proxies or networks are configured.
[ ] Confirm production secrets are not stored in committed files.
[ ] Confirm production connection strings come from environment or secret storage.
[ ] Confirm HTTPS redirects and callback URLs work externally.
[ ] Confirm Content Security Policy works with deployed assets and auth flows.
[ ] Confirm rate limits match expected traffic and monitoring behavior.
[ ] Confirm health checks are reachable by infrastructure but do not leak sensitive details.
[ ] Confirm database migration execution strategy.
[ ] Confirm logs are written to the expected production destination.
[ ] Confirm error responses do not expose sensitive implementation details.
```

Deployment readiness is environment-specific. Treat this article as a starting checklist, not a replacement for organization-specific production review.
