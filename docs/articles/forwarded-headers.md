# Forwarded Headers and Proxy Support

The application includes optional forwarded headers support for deployments behind reverse proxies,
load balancers, ingress controllers, and hosted infrastructure.

Forwarded headers allow the application to correctly resolve the original client IP address,
request scheme, and host when traffic is forwarded through another server before reaching Kestrel.

Configuration is controlled through `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ProjectTemplate": {
  "ForwardedHeaders": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "RequireExplicitProxyTrust": false,
    "Headers": [
      "XForwardedFor",
      "XForwardedProto"
    ],
    "ForwardLimit": 1,
    "RequireHeaderSymmetry": false,
    "ClearKnownNetworksAndProxies": false,
    "KnownProxies": [],
    "KnownNetworks": [],
    "AllowedHosts": []
  }
}
```

By default, the application processes:

- `X-Forwarded-For`
- `X-Forwarded-Proto`

Production deployments should explicitly configure trusted proxy IP addresses or trusted proxy
networks using `KnownProxies` or `KnownNetworks`.

Do not trust raw `X-Forwarded-For` values in application code. Forwarded headers are safe to use
only after ASP.NET Core has processed them through trusted proxy configuration. Middleware that
reads `HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress`, including request logging and client IP rate
limiting, should rely on the corrected `RemoteIpAddress` value rather than parsing forwarded
headers directly.

## Startup Trust Diagnostic

Outside the Development environment, the application emits a startup warning when all of the
following are true:

- forwarded headers are enabled and include `X-Forwarded-For`;
- application rate limiting is enabled; and
- neither `KnownProxies` nor `KnownNetworks` contains a deployment-specific trust entry.

ASP.NET Core continues to ignore forwarded values from untrusted senders. The warning does not
weaken that protection. It highlights that `RemoteIpAddress` may remain the proxy address, causing
multiple downstream clients to share one rate-limit partition and causing client-IP logs to identify
the proxy rather than the originating client.

Deployments that require an explicit trust boundary can opt into fail-fast startup validation:

```json
"ForwardedHeaders": {
  "RequireExplicitProxyTrust": true,
  "KnownProxies": [ "10.0.0.10" ],
  "KnownNetworks": [ "10.0.0.0/24" ]
}
```

`RequireExplicitProxyTrust` is ignored in Development so the template's normal loopback and local
scenarios continue to work. In every other environment, strict mode fails startup when forwarded
client-IP processing and rate limiting are active without a configured trusted proxy or network.

`UseForwardedHeaders()` must run before middleware that depends on the client IP, request scheme,
host, or path base. The template's centralized pipeline applies forwarded headers before request
logging, HTTPS redirection, routing, CORS, rate limiting, authentication, authorization, and
endpoint execution.

`XForwardedHost` is intentionally not enabled by default. If enabled, configure `AllowedHosts`
to reduce the risk of host header spoofing.
