# Build Quality and Reproducibility

This repository uses a shared build policy so local development, CI validation, container builds, template packaging, and scaffolded consumer output follow the same baseline expectations.

## SDK Policy

The repository pins the .NET SDK through `global.json`.

Current policy:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "10.0.300",
    "rollForward": "latestPatch",
    "allowPrerelease": false
  }
}
```

The pinned SDK feature band keeps local and CI builds aligned. `latestPatch` allows patch-level SDK servicing updates within the selected feature band without silently moving to a newer feature band.

CI workflows use `actions/setup-dotnet` with `global-json-file: global.json` so the repository SDK policy remains the single source of truth.

## Central Package Management

NuGet package versions are centralized in `Directory.Packages.props` by enabling:

```xml
<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>
```

Project files should reference packages without inline `Version` attributes unless a documented exception is required.

This keeps package drift visible, makes dependency review easier, and ensures scaffolded consumer output can restore with the same package policy as the source repository.

## Shared Build Properties

Common build settings live in `Directory.Build.props`.

The shared policy includes:

- `TargetFramework` set to `net10.0`.
- Nullable reference types enabled.
- Implicit usings enabled.
- Centralized version metadata.
- Deterministic builds.
- Embedded debug symbols.
- Repository metadata for Source Link.
- .NET analyzers enabled.
- Code style enforcement during build.
- XML documentation generation.

## Deterministic Builds

The build policy enables deterministic output where appropriate:

```xml
<Deterministic>true</Deterministic>
<ContinuousIntegrationBuild Condition="'$(GITHUB_ACTIONS)' == 'true'">true</ContinuousIntegrationBuild>
<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>
```

CI also passes `/p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` during release builds, template packing, scaffolded output validation, documentation builds, and container publish builds.

## Source Link

Source Link support is configured with repository metadata and the `Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub` package.

Project files that produce assemblies should include:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub" PrivateAssets="all" />
```

The CI checkout uses full history with `fetch-depth: 0` for build jobs that need repository metadata.

## Analyzer and Formatting Policy

Analyzer severity and code-style preferences are defined in `.editorconfig`.

CI enforces formatting with:

```powershell
dotnet format ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.slnx --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal
```

Analyzer settings are intentionally production-oriented but not configured as global warnings-as-errors. This allows the template to remain practical while still surfacing reliability, security, performance, usage, code-quality, and style issues during builds and IDE development.

## Release Build Quality Gates

Before a release, the expected validation path is:

```powershell
dotnet restore ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.slnx
dotnet build ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true
dotnet format ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.slnx --verify-no-changes --verbosity minimal
dotnet test ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.slnx --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true
dotnet pack ./NetCoreApplicationTemplate.Template.csproj --configuration Release --output ./artifacts/template-package /p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true
```

The CI workflow additionally:

- Runs dependency review on pull requests.
- Generates coverage reports.
- Enforces the configured coverage threshold.
- Runs CodeQL analysis.
- Packs and installs the template package.
- Scaffolds a consumer project.
- Verifies expected scaffolded files and excluded maintainer files.
- Builds and tests scaffolded output on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Scaffolded Output

The generated template intentionally includes:

- `.editorconfig`
- `global.json`
- `Directory.Build.props`
- `Directory.Packages.props`

These files are part of the consumer build contract because package versions and build quality settings are centralized at the repository root.

## Coverage Policy

The CI coverage gate is intentionally held at 60% for v1.0.0 as a minimum safety net. Contract-level integration tests protect advertised runtime behavior directly, while the global threshold prevents broad coverage regression without forcing low-value tests.

## Dependency Upgrade Policy

Dependency updates should be reviewed by impact level.

| Update Type | Review Expectation |
|:------------|:-------------------|
| Security updates | Review and merge promptly after CI passes unless the update causes a documented compatibility break. |
| Patch updates | Prefer merging after CI, template smoke tests, and dependency review pass. |
| Minor updates | Review release notes, then merge after CI and smoke tests pass. |
| Major updates | Treat as compatibility work. Review release notes, migration guides, runtime behavior, and scaffolded output before merging. |
| Runtime-sensitive updates | Manually review authentication, EF Core, middleware, logging, telemetry, container, and workflow dependencies even for patch or minor updates. |

Dependabot groups related dependencies where practical, but grouped dependency pull requests still require human review before merging.

## Version and Release Notes

The repository version is centralized in build metadata. Release notes should identify any change that affects:

- SDK feature-band policy.
- Target framework.
- Central package management.
- Analyzer severity.
- CI quality gates.
- Template scaffolded build files.
- Dependency policy.

After `v1.0.0`, changes to these items should be treated as release-surface changes because they can affect downstream generated applications.
