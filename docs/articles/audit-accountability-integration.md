# Audit Accountability Integration

NCAT records application data mutations. A companion archive, SIEM, governance service, or verification tool may record why an operation occurred, how it progressed, or whether the retained mutation records still correspond to the receipt produced when the save completed.

These records should remain distinct and be joined through shared opaque identifiers rather than copied into one another.

## Record ownership

| Record | Authoritative question |
| --- | --- |
| NCAT `AuditRecord` | What persisted application state changed? |
| Host decision or workflow record | Why was the operation allowed or initiated? |
| Host execution lifecycle record | Did the operation execute, and which NCAT mutation batch resulted? |
| Canonical mutation manifest digest | Do the retained protected audit records correspond to the completed NCAT receipt? |

NCAT does not require a governance product, SIEM vendor, archive provider, or external audit framework. The integration contracts remain host-owned and framework-neutral.

## Shared audit context

`IApplicationAuditContextAccessor` supplies structured identity and correlation data to the EF Core save pipeline.

```csharp
ApplicationAuditContext context = new(
    actorId: "user-123",
    actorType: ApplicationAuditActorTypes.Human,
    actorDisplayName: "User 123",
    operationExecutionId: "operation-456",
    executionAttemptId: "attempt-1",
    correlationId: "correlation-789",
    traceId: Activity.Current?.TraceId.ToString(),
    spanId: Activity.Current?.SpanId.ToString(),
    decisionAuditRecordId: "decision-abc");
```

The web host registers `HttpContextApplicationAuditContextAccessor`. It resolves authenticated subject or name-identifier claims, request correlation, and current trace identifiers. Infrastructure-only consumers receive a system context by default.

Applications may replace the accessor for background jobs, message handlers, deployment gates, scheduled tasks, or governed operations.

## Mutation batches and receipts

Every logical `SaveChanges` or `SaveChangesAsync` mutation set receives one `MutationBatchId`. All NCAT audit records produced by that save share the same identifier.

After the save completes, `IApplicationMutationAuditReceiptAccessor.LastCompletedReceipt` exposes a minimized receipt containing:

- mutation batch ID;
- audit record count;
- persistence outcome;
- completion timestamp;
- canonical manifest schema version;
- manifest hash algorithm and digest;
- operation execution and attempt identifiers;
- decision audit record identifier;
- correlation and trace identifiers.

The receipt intentionally excludes entity keys and original/current values. A host lifecycle record can safely retain the opaque identifiers, count, algorithm, and digest without copying audited entity values outside NCAT.

## Canonical privacy-safe mutation manifest

`IApplicationMutationManifestBuilder` creates a versioned, provider-neutral canonical JSON representation of one retained mutation batch.

Version `1.0` includes:

- manifest schema version;
- mutation batch ID;
- audit record count;
- each record's audit schema version, entity, and state;
- key, original, and current value objects;
- operation, attempt, decision, correlation, trace, and span identifiers.

Records and object properties are ordered using ordinal comparison rules. Empty audit value payloads are represented as empty JSON objects. This makes the canonical output stable across repeated runs, database return order, and JSON property insertion order.

The manifest is built from the `AuditRecord` values created after `IApplicationAuditValuePolicy` has applied inclusion, masking, hashing, omission, or truncation. Raw pre-protection entity values are not copied into the manifest merely to support hashing.

`IApplicationMutationManifestHasher` is replaceable through dependency injection. NCAT registers `Sha256ApplicationMutationManifestHasher` by default and writes `SHA-256` plus the uppercase hexadecimal digest to the receipt.

## Verification

An archive reader, SIEM adapter, governance service, or independent integrity check can load the retained `AuditRecord` batch and verify it against the receipt:

```csharp
IReadOnlyCollection<AuditRecord> retainedBatch = await dbContext.AuditRecords
    .Where(record => record.MutationBatchId == receipt.MutationBatchId)
    .ToListAsync(cancellationToken);

bool corresponds = manifestVerifier.Verify(receipt, retainedBatch);
```

Verification rebuilds the versioned canonical manifest, confirms the mutation batch and record count, recomputes the configured digest, and compares it using a fixed-time byte comparison. Verification succeeds only when the retained protected batch still corresponds to the receipt.

A successful digest comparison does **not** prove:

- that the business transaction and every audit write were durably committed atomically;
- that the records are stored in immutable or tamper-proof storage;
- that a legal, regulatory, or records-retention requirement has been satisfied;
- that the actor identity or upstream policy decision was independently authenticated;
- that a later archive transfer was complete unless that transfer retained and verified the full canonical batch.

Those guarantees require host-owned transaction strategy, access controls, retention policy, immutable storage, signing or timestamping where appropriate, and operational evidence.

## Value minimization

`IApplicationAuditValuePolicy` controls how each audited property value is represented before persistence, manifest construction, or external delivery.

Supported dispositions are:

- `Include`
- `Mask`
- `Hash`
- `Omit`
- `Truncate`

The default policy preserves the previous NCAT behavior and includes values unchanged. Production applications should replace it when entities may contain credentials, tokens, protected document bodies, personal information, or other regulated data.

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IApplicationAuditValuePolicy, ApplicationAuditValuePolicy>();
```

Redaction occurs before values are serialized into `KeyValues`, `OriginalValues`, or `CurrentValues`, and before the canonical manifest is hashed. Do not copy raw NCAT mutation values wholesale into telemetry, an external archive, a governance outbox, or a SIEM.

## Atomic local persistence

Audit records whose values are available before the primary save participate in the normal EF Core save operation. Records that depend on database-generated temporary values are completed through the after-save audit flush, which requires another `SaveChanges` call.

Applications that require the business mutation, generated-value audit completion, manifest receipt, and a database-local completion handoff to succeed or fail together can opt in to `IApplicationAuditedTransaction`:

```csharp
services.AddApplicationInfrastructureDataAccess(configuration);
services.AddApplicationAuditedTransactions();
```

The mutation delegate stages business changes. The coordinator performs the save, waits for NCAT to complete generated values and the mutation receipt, then optionally allows the host to stage a local outbox or completion record before the transaction commits.

```csharp
ApplicationAuditedTransactionResult result = await auditedTransaction.ExecuteAsync(
    (dbContext, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        dbContext.Add(order);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    },
    (dbContext, receipt, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        dbContext.Add(new ApplicationAuditCompletionOutboxEntry
        {
            MutationBatchId = receipt.MutationBatchId,
            ManifestHash = receipt.MutationManifestHash,
            ManifestAlgorithm = receipt.MutationManifestAlgorithm
        });
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    },
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

The example outbox type is host-owned. NCAT does not prescribe its schema or downstream delivery protocol.

### Transaction ownership

- With no current EF Core transaction, the coordinator creates and commits a relational transaction. An optional isolation level applies only to this coordinator-owned transaction.
- With an existing EF Core transaction, the coordinator joins it using a savepoint. The result reports `RequiresOuterCommit = true`; the caller remains responsible for the final commit or rollback.
- If the existing transaction does not support savepoints, the coordinator fails before invoking the mutation.
- Supplying a new isolation level while joining an existing transaction is rejected rather than silently ignored.
- Ambient `System.Transactions` scopes are rejected. Use an explicit EF Core transaction so ownership remains visible.
- The context must not contain unsaved changes before execution. Stage the mutation inside the coordinator delegate.

### Execution strategies and retries

Coordinator-owned transactions execute inside the provider's `Database.CreateExecutionStrategy()` delegate so a retrying provider can replay the entire transaction unit. The mutation and local-completion delegates may therefore run more than once after a transient failure. They must be idempotent and must not perform non-transactional external side effects.

Commit failures can have an unknown outcome on some providers. Hosts that enable retries should use provider guidance, stable operation identifiers, and database-enforced idempotency when duplicate execution would be harmful.

Existing transactions are not replayed by the coordinator because the outer owner controls their execution strategy.

### Guarantee boundary

The atomicity guarantee covers only writes made through the same `ApplicationDbContext` and database transaction. It does not make an external sink, message broker, SIEM, archive, or governance service part of the database commit.

Persist only a durable local handoff inside the transaction. Deliver it externally after commit through a separate dispatcher with retry and idempotency behavior.

Direct `SaveChanges` and `SaveChangesAsync` remain available for applications that do not opt in. Their existing behavior is unchanged.

## Generic integration sequence

```text
Host decision or workflow record
        -> shared operation execution identity
        -> audited transaction coordinator
        -> NCAT SaveChanges mutation batch
        -> generated-value audit completion
        -> protected canonical mutation manifest
        -> NCAT mutation audit receipt with digest
        -> database-local completion handoff
        -> transaction commit
        -> external dispatcher delivery
        -> later retained-batch verification
```

Only opaque identifiers, counts, algorithms, hashes, and minimized metadata need to cross system boundaries. NCAT remains authoritative for mutation details, while each external system remains authoritative for its own decision, lifecycle, alerting, or retention responsibilities.
